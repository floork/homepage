      <description>In this Post I want to talk about the creation of this Homepage
Static Site Generator To create this site I used the Static Site Generator, originally I wanted to use Jekyll, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really found a theme that I liked. So instead I switched to Hugo where I found PaperMod and later PaperModX which is a really nice theme.
Hosting To host this Website originally I used Github Pages, but since I wanted to test Netlify i thought why not use it to host the website and so I did.</description>
