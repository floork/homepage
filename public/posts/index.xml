      <description>Plinx is my personal Postinstall Script to configure my whole Desktop. It is an acronym and it stands for Post Linuxinstall Script(+x for executible) With Plinx I want to automate my Linux configuration so that when ever I want to switch my Distro, I just have to run this script and it does everthing for me.
Install git clone https://github.com/floork/plinx cd ./plinx ./install Features Copy configs install Programs Content Flatpaks com.</description>

      <description>In this Post I want to talk about the creation of this Homepage
Static Site Generator To create this site I used the Static Site Generator, originally I wanted to use Jekyll, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really found a theme that I liked. So instead I switched to Hugo where I found PaperMod and later PaperModX which is a really nice theme.
Hosting To host this Website originally I used Github Pages, but since I wanted to test Netlify i thought why not use it to host the website and so I did.</description>
