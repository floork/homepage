      Hello there! I am an IT-Specialist in training, fueled by an immense love
      for technology and a commitment to honing my skills. Currently, I am proud
      to contribute my expertise to the renowned TU-Dresden, where I am immersed
      in the exciting world of IT.


      My journey involves mastering a spectrum of technologies, including Linux,
      Python, C++, Bash scripting, Vue.js, Docker, and nvim. Each of these tools
      plays a crucial role in my quest for excellence as an IT-Specialist.


      At the core of my enthusiasm lies the belief in technology's
      transformative power. From delving into the intricacies of Python and C++
      to optimizing system performance with Docker, I thrive on the challenges
      that IT presents. As a perpetual learner, I actively seek opportunities to
      expand my knowledge, staying ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving
      field.
