In this Post I want to talk about the creation of this Homepage

## Static Site Generator

To create this site I used the Static Site Generator, originally I wanted to use Jekyll, but I haven't really found a theme that I liked. So instead I switched to Hugo where I found PaperMod and later PaperModX which is a really nice theme.

## Hosting
To host this Website originally I used Github Pages, but since I wanted to test Netlify i thought why not use it to host the website and so I did. I'm really happy with my decision and I think it's a really easy process everyone should try.
